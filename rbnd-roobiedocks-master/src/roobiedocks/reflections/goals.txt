My goal is to work more on the web side of things. I've mainly spent most of my experience as a developer doing desktop based applications and have done little web based coding. Since the internet is such a prevelant technology and ever growing, it is to pervasive to ignore. Thus, my goal is to use ruby, and specifically ruby on rails to learn how to develop web applications and increase my exposure to web based programming. This will help deversify my skill set and make me a more valuable developer.
